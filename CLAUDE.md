# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Interactive geometry exhibit for artist Gregg Fleishman. Static multi-page site; no build step. Deploys to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch via `.nojekyll`.

## Commands

There is **no build, lint, or test tooling** — it's vendored static HTML/CSS/JS. Do not look for `package.json`, npm scripts, or a test runner; there are none.

**Run locally** (ES-module import maps require `http://`, not `file://`):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/
```
(`.claude/launch.json` defines the same server on port 8080.)

**Regenerate the Lost Triangle bundles** after editing `assets/lost-triangle/*.jsx` (the `.js` files are transpiled output — never hand-edit them). Run from `assets/lost-triangle/` with `@babel/standalone` available:
```js
const Babel = require('@babel/standalone');
const fs = require('fs');
for (const [src, out] of [['animations.jsx','animations.js'], ['LostTriangleVideo.jsx','lost-triangle-video.js']]) {
  fs.writeFileSync(out, Babel.transform(fs.readFileSync(src,'utf8'), { presets:['react'], compact:false }).code);
}
```

**URL params** (chrome-hiding toggles on the animated pages): `?embed=1` hides the site nav (for iframing — used by `construction.html`), `?cover=1` hides all UI chrome (used by the `index.html` hero iframe), `?clean=1` hides all chrome for clean video capture on the movie pages.

---

## Key Rules

- **Never commit directly to `main`** — GitHub Pages deploys from it. All work goes on a feature branch; open a draft PR.
- No build step. Edit HTML/CSS/JS files directly.
- All Three.js and GSAP are **vendored** under `assets/vendor/` — no CDN, no npm.

## Two Navigation Systems

### Outer Site Nav (index, about, portfolio, store, contact)
```
About · Work · Geometry · Store · Contact
```
- All outer pages use **"Geometry" → `index.html`** (the hub). `index.html` marks it active. (Previously inconsistent: index linked to itself while the others used "The Math" → `mathematics.html`; unified June 2026.)

### Geometry Exhibit Nav (all geometry pages)
```
[brand] Gregg Fleishman · The Lost Triangle · Animation · The Cube · Research
```
- Present on all **18 geometry pages** via shared `<nav id="gfnav">`, identical order everywhere. (Re-unified July 2026: the `Animation → lost-triangle.html` entry had drifted out of 15 of the 18 pages, leaving a stale 4-item nav; it's now restored everywhere, with exactly one correct `active` item per page.)
- `gf-nav.js` auto-enhances this nav with a responsive hamburger at ≤820px.
- **Order encodes the intended learning journey: scroll → animation → model.**
  - **"The Lost Triangle" → `mathematics.html`** — the long-form narrative **scroll** (the entry point of the journey).
  - **"Animation" → `lost-triangle.html`** — the accurate React motion graphic.
  - **"The Cube" → `explore.html`** — the interactive 3D model.
- There is no longer a "Construction" nav item; `construction.html` is an orphaned deep-dive (active context = Animation).
- There is no longer a top-nav "Vector Pod" item (removed July 2026) — it was redundant with the "Vector Pod" tab already inside `explore.html`'s tab bar. `vector-pod/index.html` is still reachable via that tab, and via the "Vector Pod" link in `index.html`'s own content index.
- There is no longer a top-nav "Rhombic System" item (removed July 2026) — it's now folded into `explore.html` as a "Rhombic System" tab (iframe of `rhombic-system.html?embed=1`), same pattern as the "Vector Pod" tab. `rhombic-system.html` still exists standalone and marks "The Cube" active in its own nav (it no longer has a nav item of its own).

### Orphaned Deep-Dive Pages
These are accessible by URL only — not linked from any nav:
- `fleishman-sequence.html` — cinematic sequence (active nav → Animation)
- `cluster-structures.html` — a tab inside `explore.html`, currently **hidden** from the tab bar (active nav → The Cube)
- `lost-triangle-construction.html` — 2D animated construction (active nav → Animation)
- `lost-triangle-construction-3d.html` — 3D construction proof (active nav → Animation)
- `cube-diagonals.html` — cube diagonal deep-dive (active nav → The Lost Triangle)
- `rhombic-system.html` — rhombic dodecahedron system, now a tab inside `explore.html` (active nav → The Cube)
- `rhombic-dodecahedron.html` — rhombic dodecahedron (active nav → The Cube)
- `fleishman-vector-system.html` — vector system (active nav → The Cube)
- `vector-house.html` — vector house form (active nav → The Cube)
- `lost-triangle-motion.html` — looping canvas animation (active nav → Animation), embedded as iframe in `index.html`
- `fleishman-ground-angle.html` — GSAP-timeline construction showing the Lost Triangle arrived at from a unit square tilted 35.25° off the ground, rather than built up from the cube (active nav → The Cube; linked from the "The Cube" tab's masthead and cross-links to `fleishman-proof-3d.html`)
- `fleishman-proof-3d.html` — the proof triangle parsed directly from Gregg's original `proof triangle with angles.3dm` via `assets/lost-triangle/fleishman-proof-data.js` (a new data file, distinct from `fleishman-proof-data-math27.js` / `fleishman-proof-data-stations-clean.js`) (active nav → The Cube; linked from the "The Cube" tab's masthead and cross-links to `fleishman-ground-angle.html`)
- `truncated-octahedron.html` — space-filling deep-dive (July 2026): the exact truncated octahedron computed from the 24 signed permutations of (0,1,2), the three gold angle arcs (45° · 35.26° · 54.74° = arctan√2) swept between the 1/√2/√3 direction spokes, and the 14-neighbour BCC packing animation; Cube + Rhombic-dodecahedron ghost overlays toggle the space-filling family (active nav → The Cube; linked from the "The Cube" tab's `.deepdive` masthead pills; cross-links to `vector-pod/index.html` + `rhombic-system.html`). Instrument-panel chrome matches the Vector Pod app's language (breadcrumb + big title; a left "Mode" stepper — The cell → Packing → The Pod → The House — walks from the pure geometry to Gregg's actual built structures, lazy-loading `assets/models/rhomi-pod.glb` / `vector-house.glb` and auto-framing the camera to whatever's on screen; a right "Geometry layers" panel has real eye-toggle rows for Squares/Hexagons/Angles/Lost Triangle/Cube/Rhombic-dodeca; a bottom view-dock has Perspective/Top/Front/Right camera presets + Rotate/Replay/Pause). Renderer is Three.js r160 ESM (converted from the r128 global pattern other deep-dives use, to share the GLTFLoader + MeshoptDecoder). `#wrap` is deliberately `calc(100vh - 56px)`, not the `100vh` used elsewhere — the sticky `#gfnav` sits in normal flow above it, so a plain `100vh` wrap overflows the viewport by the nav's height and clips anything bottom-anchored; if you copy this page's structure elsewhere, carry the `calc()` too. `#formula`/`#note`'s vertical space is set by JS (`layoutColumns()`), not a fixed `vh` guess, so short viewports (e.g. 1024×768 laptop-landscape) can't overlap the mode/layer panels above them — it measures the real rendered height and applies a `scroll-fade` mask class only when content still doesn't fit.

---

## Theming System

The site is **dark-only**. The light theme was **fully removed** (June 2026): no toggle button, no `data-theme` switching, no `[data-theme="light"]` CSS rules anywhere, and `gf-theme.js` is now an inert dark-only stub. The dark tokens below are the entire palette.

### `assets/gf-tokens.css`
Single source of truth for CSS custom properties. Drop-in replacement on all 17+ pages.

Key variables:
- `--bg: #070a0b` — the void (near-black)
- `--tx: #e5e0d4` — parchment text
- `--accent: #c9a24b` — desert gold (UI chrome, active states)
- `--geo-unit: #e5e0d4` — edge = 1
- `--geo-face: #6f9bc4` — face diagonal √2 (blue)
- `--geo-space: #db684d` — space diagonal √3 / Lost Triangle (terracotta)
- `--geo-tri: #77a485` — root triangle fill (green)
- `--geo-angle: #c9a24b` — angle measures (gold)

### `assets/gf-theme.js`
- Inert dark-only compatibility stub. Sets `<meta name="theme-color">` to the dark value and clears any stale `localStorage['gf-theme']`.
- Exposes a no-op back-compat API — `window.gfTheme.get()/.set()/.toggle()` all return `'dark'` — so any leftover caller can't crash. Still loaded (via `<script>`) on every page; safe to keep.

### `assets/gf-scene.js`
- Exposes `window.GF_SCENE` with a **single `dark` palette** object: `bg[]`, `ink`, `unit`, `face`, `space`, `tri`, `angle`, `halo`.
- Colors are CSS hex strings; `THREE.Color` parses them directly.
- `GF_SCENE.active()` and `GF_SCENE.name()` always return the dark palette / `'dark'` (the light palette was removed). `GF_SCENE.onChange()` is a no-op (the `gf-themechange` event no longer fires).

**Note:** new WebGL pages should still read `const SC = GF_SCENE.dark` (or `.active()` — both return dark now). The historical mustard/gold background bug (caused by `.active()` returning a stored light palette) can no longer occur, since there is no light palette.

---

## WebGL Pages

### Three.js r160 ESM (modern pages)
Most pages use an `<script type="importmap">` pointing to `assets/vendor/three-0.160.0/`.

**Renderer setup convention** (follow this pattern in new pages):
```javascript
const SC = GF_SCENE.dark;  // always .dark, never .active()
const BGc = new THREE.Color(SC.bg[1] || '#0B0B0B');
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setClearColor(BGc, 1);
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(devicePixelRatio, 2));
renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.NoToneMapping;
```

**explore.html** — 5 tabs (1 currently hidden from the tab bar), each its own `<script type="module">` or iframe:
1. **The Cube** — characteristic tetrahedra assembly; fat lines (Line2/LineMaterial); OrbitControls; GSAP timeline
2. **Cluster Structures** — GSAP animation sequence. **Hidden as of July 2026** — the `<button data-tab="cs">` is commented out of the tab bar, but the `#scene-cs` markup/script and the `'cs'` entry in the tab-switcher's `scenes` array are untouched, so restoring it is a one-line uncomment.
3. **Vector System** — tiled cube frame with assembly pattern
4. **Rhombic System** — iframe to `rhombic-system.html?embed=1` (added July 2026, replacing its former top-nav slot)
5. **Vector Pod** — iframe to `vector-pod/index.html`

**construction.html** — no tab bar; full-bleed `<iframe src="lost-triangle.html?embed=1">` filling the space below the nav. The Cluster Structures tab (Three.js r160 + GSAP) was removed; its standalone page `cluster-structures.html` still exists by URL but is no longer linked from the nav.

(The earlier 3D Construction and Fleishman Sequence tabs were removed in PR #4 — their standalone pages `lost-triangle-construction-3d.html` and `fleishman-sequence.html` still exist by URL but are not in the nav.)

### React — Lost Triangle motion graphic (`lost-triangle.html`)
`lost-triangle.html` mounts a React app from vendored React 18.3.1 UMD (`assets/vendor/react-18.3.1/`). The JSX is **pre-transpiled** to plain JS — no in-browser Babel. Load order: `react` → `react-dom` → `animations.js` (defines `Stage`/`Sprite`/`Easing`/`useTime` on `window`) → `lost-triangle-video.js` (defines `window.LostTriangleVideoClean` + `LostTriangleVideoCleanPortrait`) → inline mount into `#lt-root`.

This is the **"Clean" build** — a faithful port of the Claude Design file `Lost Triangle Clean.dc.html` (pure full-canvas animation, no side panels). 7 scenes: Intro · Root Spiral · Triangle Construction · Cube · Reflected into Form · Dihedral Angles · Close (75s). Palette magenta `#FF00CC` / steel blue / gold on near-black; fonts Syne · Cormorant Garamond · Space Grotesk.

- **Edit the `.jsx`, not the `.js`** — the `.js` bundles are generated from `animations.jsx` / `LostTriangleVideoClean.jsx`. Re-transpile with `cd assets/lost-triangle && npm install --no-save @babel/standalone && node build.mjs` (see `assets/lost-triangle/README.md`).
- The figure geometry is **computed** from one edge length, so every `1 : √2 : √3` relationship is exact by construction — don't "correct" it to eyeballed coordinates.
- `?embed=1` hides the site nav so the page can be framed inside `construction.html`.
- The mount picks the layout by viewport aspect ratio — `LostTriangleVideoCleanPortrait` (1080×1920) on portrait, `LostTriangleVideoClean` (1920×1080) otherwise. Both share one Stage `persistKey` (`animstage-clean`), so the playhead carries across an orientation flip automatically.

### Three.js r128 (older deep-dive pages)
`cube-diagonals.html`, `dorman-luke.html`, `rhombic-dodecahedron.html`, `rhombic-system.html`, `fleishman-vector-system.html`, `vector-house.html` load Three.js r128 via `<script src="assets/vendor/three-r128/three.min.js">`. These use the global `THREE` object (not ESM).

### Canvas 2D
`lost-triangle-motion.html` and `lost-triangle-construction.html` use `assets/lost-triangle-engine.js` — a pure Canvas 2D renderer with manual isometric/dihedral projection. No dependencies.

---

## `explore.html` Specifics

The most complex page — five scenes in one file (one hidden from the tab bar, two of the five are iframes).

**Tab switching**: `activate(id)` at the bottom of the file shows/hides `.con-scene` divs via `display:block/none`. The animate loop for each scene guards on `sceneCubeEl.style.display === 'none'` to pause when hidden.

**Color palette loading sequence**:
```javascript
const SC = GF_SCENE.dark;  // synchronous — gf-scene.js loaded before this module
const BGc = new THREE.Color(SC.bg[1]);
const COL = { bg: BGc.getHex(), bone: ..., gold: ..., ... };
renderer.setClearColor(COL.bg, 1);
scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(COL.bg, 4.2, 11.5);
```

**Known state**: `buildComposers()` (bloom post-processing) was removed as dead code — it was defined but never called. The render loop uses direct `renderer.render(scene, camera)`.

---

## Cover Hero (index.html)

`index.html` embeds `lost-triangle-motion.html?cover=1` as a fixed, pointer-inert iframe background. The `?cover=1` param (or `html.gf-cover` class) hides all UI chrome inside the embedded page. A scrim gradient provides text legibility over the animation.

## Baseline Standards (every page must meet these — July 2026)

These are the site-wide conventions to preserve and apply to any new page.

### Responsive / legibility
- **No horizontal scroll, ever.** `gf-tokens.css` sets `html, body { overflow-x: clip }` globally. `clip` (not `hidden`) is deliberate: it contains stray full-bleed / fixed off-canvas children (e.g. the slide-down mobile menu, whose `right:0` box is sized against the scrollbar-inclusive containing block) **without** establishing a scroll container, so `position:sticky` keeps working. Don't remove it; don't "fix" a page by adding another scroll container.
- **content-box is the site default** (there is no global `* { box-sizing:border-box }` reset). When a flex/grid child can overflow its parent — typically a stacked CTA panel on phones — contain it explicitly: `min-width:0; max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box`. Watch cascade order: a base rule placed *after* a `@media` block will clobber the responsive override (equal specificity → later source wins) — put the responsive override after the base, or bump its specificity.
- **Portrait vs landscape.** Fixed 16:9 animation bundles have no portrait layout. Two accepted patterns: (a) ship a portrait variant (as `lost-triangle.html` does via `LostTriangleVideoCleanPortrait`, picked by aspect ratio), or (b) upright scale-to-fit letterbox, vertically centered, at any aspect (as `mathematics-preview.html` does — each slide's own stage handles the fitting; `preview-slide.html?s=<key>` is the minimal iframe host for the plain-React slides). Two things were tried on the preview page and **rejected by the owner** (July 2026) — do not reintroduce either: a "rotate your device" blocker, and rotate-to-fill (rotating the composition 90° in portrait — sideways text on an upright screen). Content renders upright at every scale; a true portrait experience means authoring a portrait variant, pattern (a). The Three Angles bundle (`assets/lost-triangle/lt-intro.html`) does this **inside one bundle**: its `fit()` switches to a 540×960 portrait design box (recentered projection, smaller home scale, orientation-scaled zoom clamps, dynamic viewBox), the drawn chrome (legend/caption/brand) repositions from `this._por`, and the template chrome moves via `html.lt-portrait` CSS classes — use it as the reference when porting other bundles.

### `<head>` metadata (every page)
- Unique, specific `<title>` in the form `<Specific Name> — Gregg Fleishman`, **em-dash "—" as the top-level separator** (not a hyphen, not a middot).
- A one-sentence `<meta name="description">` describing that page.
- Open Graph + Twitter card block (template lives in `index.html`): `og:type/site_name/title/description/url/image/image:alt` + `twitter:card/title/description/image`. `og:url` is the page's own GitHub Pages URL; `og:image` is an **absolute** GitHub Pages URL (resolves from any host, incl. the Vercel previews).

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Gold background on WebGL pages** (historical, now impossible): was caused by `GF_SCENE.active()` returning a stored light palette for the clear color. The light palette is gone, so `.active()` and `.dark` both return dark. Still prefer `GF_SCENE.dark` for clarity in new code.

2. **Color space**: Three.js r160 stores colors in linear space internally. Always set `renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace` explicitly to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Fog color**: Pass a `THREE.Color` object or the `.bg` hex string from `GF_SCENE.dark` — not a CSS variable that might not resolve at module-parse time.

4. **Mobile menu**: `gf-nav.js` is idempotent — safe to include on any page with `<nav id="gfnav">`. It builds the `#gf-mobilemenu` at runtime.

5. **`vector-pod/` is compiled output — edit `vector-pod-src/` instead.** The `vector-pod/` folder is Vite build output (minified JS/CSS); editing it directly is pointless. The **editable React 19 + Vite + TS source now lives in-repo at `vector-pod-src/`** (added July 2026 — previously it was an external package and the compiled bundle had to be hot-patched). To change the app:
   ```bash
   cd vector-pod-src && pnpm install && pnpm build
   # then copy the fresh build into the served folder (filenames are content-hashed):
   rm -f ../vector-pod/assets/index-*.js ../vector-pod/assets/index-*.css
   cp dist/index.html ../vector-pod/index.html
   cp dist/assets/index-*.js dist/assets/index-*.css ../vector-pod/assets/
   ```
   `vite.config.ts` sets `base: './'` so the served paths are relative (it lives under `/vector-pod/`). `vector-pod/favicon.svg` + `icons.svg` are not emitted by the build — preserve them across redeploys. The old "VERTOR POD" → "VECTOR POD" typo is now **fixed in source** (App.tsx masthead + aria-label, `index.html` title/description, and `modelData.ts` `meta.source`); don't reintroduce it. The app renders **baked NURBS edge wireframes** (`modelData.ts`), plus a toggle-able **"Truncated octahedron" overlay** (`truncatedOctahedron.ts` — feature-edges extracted from Gregg's `Rhombic_dodeca.glb`, which despite the filename is a truncated octahedron: 8 hexagons on the cube-corner directions + 6 squares on the axes, baked at the pod's native ×41.97 part-scale so its shared corner panels sit 1:1 inside the pod); geometry is decoded from base64 Int16×quantum, not loaded from GLB at runtime.
